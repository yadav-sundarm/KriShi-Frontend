          <h1>Our Vision</h1>
          <p>
            At Krishi Reboot, our vision is to revolutionize small-scale farming
            in India by equipping farmers with affordable, climate-resilient,
            and easy-to-use tools. We aim to empower 10 lakh farmers by 2030
            through portable crop protection and on-field soil testing solutions
            that increase yield, reduce risk, and support data-driven decisions
            â€” all in their local language and at their fingertips.
